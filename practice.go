package main

// Problem 1: Write a function that bubble sorts a slice of integers in ascending order.
// The function should take a slice of integers as input and return the sorted slice.
// Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list,
// compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
// The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.
func BubbleSort(arr []int) []int {
	return arr
}

// Problem 2: Write a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome.
// A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters
// that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).
// The function should take a string as input and return a boolean indicating whether it is a palindrome.
func IsPalindrome(s string) bool {
	return false
}
